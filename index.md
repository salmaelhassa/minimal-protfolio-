### Affective Bias and Electrophysiology as Biomarkers of Treatment Resistant Depression 

Designed and implemented a year-long clinical research project in [***Dr. Kelly Bijanki's Neurosurgery lab***](https://www.bcm.edu/research/faculty-labs/kelly-bijanki-lab), focusing on studying the covariance of depression symptom severity with electroencephalogram (sEEG) recordings.

#### Covid-19 Vaccinations in US Data

<div style="text-align: justify">Since the COVID vaccine was created, much data has been collected. The data ranges from how many people have been vaccinated, the rate of vaccination, and how has COVID subsided since the vaccine rollout. Many people tend to underestimate or overestimate the impact COVID has had worldwide, thus it is important to highlight the data to the worldwide audience but we have focused on the US. This data will help businesses and governments predict when they can start operating businesses with less restrictions, reopening schools, and transitioning to live similar to pre-covid.</div>

<div style="text-align: justify">In order to predict whether a message is spam, first I vectorized text messages into a format that machine learning algorithms can understand using Bag-of-Word and TF-IDF. Then I trained a machine learning model to learn to discriminate between normal and spam messages. Finally, with the trained model, I classified unlabel messages into normal or spam.</div>

### Kaggle Competition: Predict Ames House Price using Lasso, Ridge, XGBoost and LightGBM

[![Open Notebook](https://img.shields.io/badge/Jupyter-Open_Notebook-blue?logo=Jupyter)](projects/ames-house-price.html)
[![View on GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/GitHub-View_on_GitHub-blue?logo=GitHub)](https://github.com/chriskhanhtran/kaggle-house-price/blob/master/ames-house-price.ipynb)

<div style="text-align: justify">I performed comprehensive EDA to understand important variables, handled missing values, outliers, performed feature engineering, and ensembled machine learning models to predict house prices. My best model had Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of 12293.919, ranking <b>95/15502</b>, approximately <b>top 0.6%</b> in the Kaggle leaderboard.</div>
